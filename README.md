React Native Uber clone. This project simulates a trip in the Uber application, using the user current localization and directions module from React Native to create the route :blue_car:
 
 ## Getting Started
 
You need to create a [Google Cloud Platform API Key](https://console.cloud.google.com) to use maps and autocomplete features. Use this key in the project.

The API key used in this project was already excluded, it was only a example. You can use a .env file.

To install all dependencies, you need to run the following command:

```sh
$ yarn
```

To run the project, you must have installed Android and/or iOS environment. Use 'run-ios' or 'run-android':

```sh
$ react-native run-ios
```
